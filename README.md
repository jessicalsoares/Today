# Learnings
While building this app, I learned how to:

- Use SwiftUI‚Äôs `List` and `Form` components for data entry and display;<br>
- Manage data persistence with Codable and local storage;<br>
- Implement notifications using UserNotifications framework;<br>
- Handle state with `@State` and `@ObservedObject`;<br>
- Design user-friendly interfaces focusing on usability and accessibility;
